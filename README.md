# cresis_project
Some tools to work with CReSIS data without having to use MATLAB to do the data manipulation.

## A note on code style
Yes, pretty much all of this needs to be rewritten to be less... the way it is. If you
haven't read any of the code yet, maybe consider sticking with that. Right now the 
focus is on figuring out what I need it to do and what components will be 
required to make that happen. Once everything is mostly functional I'll go back 
and clean it up. 

This is very much a work in progress and very early in development. The 
requirements are changing rapidly and the code is changing to match.

## Installation
python dependencies (incomplete list): 
- numpy
- scipy
- matplotlib
- pickle
- basemap
- shapely


## Lessons Learned
- if it says that you need to load mat73, you didn't save the layer file in the OPR tools.
